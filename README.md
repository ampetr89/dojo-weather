# Current weather conditions

Search for a US city and see the current weather conditions. As you type a city name, it suggests US cities to you, based on [Mapzen search API](https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/search/). You can still enter an international city and hit Enter to see its weather.

**Note** You will have to accept the warning message to "Load unsafe scripts." This is because the OpenWeatherMap API transfers data over non-secure HTTP.

Todo: 
* Let users toggle between Celcius and Fahrenheit
* Add forecase using the 5-day / hourly forecast api
* Show a map with an icon so you have the right location (Portland Oregon vs Maine)
* set the background to look like the weather, including if night or day
